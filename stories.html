					<h1> Why are stories important? </h1>
					<p>  &ensp;&ensp;We might not realise just how much we are ifluenced by the stories we randomly hear or read. When we are children, especially, we are like sponges and absorb informations from anywhere. One can also say that our moral compass is also created at childhood, this is where stories play an important role. We subconciously try to be like the characters we admire and also create our moral values from what we see/read, this is why what we come in contact with when we are children is very important.

								<a>> The Little Mermaid</a>
								<p id="LittleMermaid"> 
									&ensp;&ensp;The Little Mermaid tells of a young mermaid princess who dreams of the human world above the sea. One day, she rescues a prince from a shipwreck and falls in love with him. Desperate to be with him, she makes a deal with a sea witch, trading her beautiful voice for human legs. The spell allows her to live on land, but she must win the prince’s love, or she will die and become sea foam.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;On land, she finds the prince, but he falls in love with another woman, believing her to be his rescuer. Heartbroken, the Little Mermaid faces an impossible choice: she can save her life by killing the prince, but she loves him too much to harm him. Instead, she throws herself into the sea, where she transforms into a spirit of the air, granted the chance to earn an immortal soul through good deeds.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;This tale of love, sacrifice, and identity has captivated audiences for generations.

								<a>> The Ugly Duckling</a>
								<p id="UglyDuck">
									&ensp;&ensp;The story of The Ugly Duckling begins with a mother duck whose eggs hatch, revealing several fluffy ducklings—except one, who is large, gray, and clumsy. The other ducklings, along with many animals at the farm, mock him, calling him "ugly" and rejecting him.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;Feeling lonely and unloved, the "ugly duckling" runs away and spends a harsh winter in solitude. He endures many hardships, surviving storms and cold, all while longing to belong.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;Finally, when spring arrives, he sees a group of graceful swans gliding on a lake. Admiring their beauty, he wishes he could be like them. But to his surprise, when he looks at his reflection in the water, he realizes he has grown into a beautiful swan himself.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;Now embraced by the other swans, he learns that he was never ugly—he was simply different and had been growing into his true self all along. The story teaches that true beauty and worth come from within and can take time to be revealed.

								<a>> The Emperor's new Clothes</a>
								<p id="EmpNClot">
									&ensp;&ensp;In The Emperor’s New Clothes, a vain emperor is obsessed with fine clothing. One day, two swindlers arrive, claiming to make the most magnificent clothes from a fabric so fine it is invisible to anyone stupid or unfit for their job. Intrigued, the emperor hires them and eagerly waits for his new outfit.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;The swindlers pretend to weave the “magical” cloth on empty looms and show the emperor nothing, knowing no one will admit they can’t see it. Afraid of appearing foolish, the emperor and his ministers all pretend to admire the invisible fabric.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;On the day of the grand parade, the emperor “dresses” in his new clothes and proudly marches through the streets, with townspeople also afraid to admit they see nothing. Finally, a child blurts out, “The emperor has no clothes!” breaking the illusion. The crowd begins to laugh, and the embarrassed emperor realizes the truth, but he continues the parade, holding onto his dignity.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;The story highlights the dangers of vanity, pride, and the power of truth spoken by the innocent.

Shivering in the bitter cold, barefoot and hungry, she huddles in a corner, too afraid to return home empty-handed, where her father would scold her.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;Desperate for warmth, she lights one of her matches. In its glow, she imagines a cozy stove, but the warmth fades as the match burns out. She lights another and envisions a splendid feast, with a table full of delicious food. Another match reveals a beautiful Christmas tree. Each match she lights brings a vision of comfort, but each one quickly fades.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;Finally, she strikes her last match and sees her beloved grandmother, the only person who had ever shown her love. In this final vision, her grandmother takes her in her arms, and together, they rise to heaven. The next morning, townspeople find the little girl’s body in the snow, with a peaceful smile on her face.<br>
									&ensp;&ensp;The story is a poignant reminder of the harsh realities faced by the poor and the power of hope, even in the darkest moments.

				<h1> Sherlock Holmes </h1>
				<p>
					&ensp;&ensp;Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He first appeared in A Study in Scarlet (1887) and has since become one of the most famous characters in literature. Holmes is a “consulting detective,” solving complex cases using his remarkable powers of observation, logical reasoning, and forensic science.
					<br>
					&ensp;&ensp;Holmes lives at 221B Baker Street, London, and is often accompanied by his loyal friend and biographer, Dr. John Watson, who narrates most of the stories. Holmes is eccentric, highly intelligent, and deeply focused on his work, often displaying an aloof or arrogant demeanor. Despite this, he has moments of warmth and humor, particularly in his interactions with Watson.
					<br>
					&ensp;&ensp;Holmes’s character is defined by his analytical mind and ability to deduce facts from seemingly trivial details. He uses tools like a magnifying glass and chemical experiments to solve mysteries, becoming a pioneer in fictional forensic science. His catchphrase, “Elementary, my dear Watson,” though widely associated with him, never actually appears in Conan Doyle’s works.
					<br>
					&ensp;&ensp;The Holmes canon includes four novels (A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of the Four, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Valley of Fear) and 56 short stories compiled in collections like The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. His cases often involve murder, theft, and deception, and his adversaries include the infamous Professor Moriarty, known as the "Napoleon of Crime."
					<br>
					&ensp;&ensp;Holmes's cultural impact is immense, inspiring countless adaptations in books, films, and TV series. He is celebrated for popularizing detective fiction and influencing modern investigative methods. Over a century after his creation, Sherlock Holmes remains a timeless symbol of intellect and problem-solving.

					&ensp;&ensp;The Arthurian Legends are a collection of stories and myths centered around King Arthur, the legendary ruler of Camelot, and his knights of the Round Table.

					<li>The Round Table: Representing equality among Arthur's knights.</li>
					<li>Knights: Heroes like Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, and Sir Galahad, who exemplify bravery and honor.</li>
					<li>The Holy Grail: A mystical object sought by the knights, symbolizing spiritual perfection.</li>

					<h3> Importance today </h3>

					&ensp;&ensp;The Arthurian Legends have shaped Western ideas of heroism, leadership, and morality. They emphasize timeless values like courage, loyalty, and the pursuit of justice.

					<h1> Faust </h1>
					<p>
						&ensp;&ensp;Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is a two-part tragic play, written over several decades and considered one of the greatest works in Western literature. The play follows the story of Dr. Heinrich Faust, a scholar dissatisfied with his life, who makes a pact with Mephistopheles (the Devil) in exchange for worldly pleasures and knowledge. Throughout the work, Faust struggles with themes of ambition, desire, despair, and the search for meaning. He seeks transcendence through various experiences, but ultimately, his journey is about striving for self-improvement and redemption.
						<br>
						&ensp;&ensp;The play intertwines elements of folklore, philosophy, and Christian theology, touching on questions of morality, the human soul, and the limits of human knowledge. Goethe presents Faust as a symbol of humanity's eternal quest for meaning and fulfillment.
					</p>
				
					<h3> Importance today </h3>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 20px;">
						&ensp;&ensp;Faust remains relevant today due to its exploration of the human condition—our desires, moral dilemmas, and the pursuit of personal growth. The work delves into timeless questions about the nature of happiness, the dangers of unchecked ambition, and the consequences of making compromises with one's values. It continues to inspire literature, philosophy, and art, reflecting the complexities of modern existential thought. The play’s themes of self-discovery and the quest for meaning resonate deeply in an era marked by uncertainty and rapid change.
